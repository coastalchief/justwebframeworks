Definitely the most difficult question: From where do we start ?

ruby, java, python, C#, clojure, PHP, perl, groovy, smalltalk, scala, javascript, lua, objective-c, common-lisp, erlang, scheme, you name itâ€¦.

As a start and as a general rule: we are posting this all unordered. we have our favourites but this would be another website.
