JavaServer(tm) Faces is the well-established standard for web-development frameworks in Java. The standard is based on the MVC paradigm, but is additionally to most web-frameworks also component-based and event-oriented.

This example uses MyFaces, therefore IÂ´d like to add some words about MyFaces. Apache MyFaces is a project of the Apache Software Foundation, and hosts several sub-projects relating to the JavaServer(tm) technology.

The Apache MyFaces project provides:

a JavaServer(tm) Faces implementation (MyFaces API, MyFaces Impl modules)
several component libraries containing UI widgets for building web-applications with JSF (e.g. MyFaces Tomahawk, MyFaces Trinidad, MyFaces Tobago)
extension packages to JavaServer(tm) Faces (e.g. MyFaces Orchestra, MyFaces Extensions Validator, MyFaces Extensions CDI)
integration modules to other technologies and standards (e.g. MyFaces Portlet Bridge for integration with the portlet-standard)
