Rango is a ultralightweight, ultracustomizable, Rack-based, ultracool web framework by Jakub Šťastný inspired by Django. Rango itself doesn’t define any runtime dependencies, since you may want to use just a subset of Rango, i. e. just template layer.


Rango doesn’t force you to anything, it’s up to you to do the design decisions. We believe in simplicity andlightweight tools for one purpose rather than one big bloated everything-solving magic beast.

Rango loves Rack, it uses it as much as possible rather than hide it as some other frameworks. Thanks to Rack, Rango is incredibly powerful: there is huge amount of Rack middlewares you can use, you can choose your favourite router, you can use amazing Warden for authentication, whatever!

There’re some good articles and a tutorial available also the github rango repository if you want to get a feel for the project and why you might consider using it.
