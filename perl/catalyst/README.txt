The Catalyst Web Framework is a comprehensive and flexible environment for quickly building high-functionality applications and is aimed at medium- to large-scale web projects. Catalyst has been designed with rapid development, scalability, extendability and maintenance in mind, including strong belief in backwards compatible deployment. Catalyst is based on the MVC (Model, View, Controller) design pattern, components are cleanly separated and easily interchangeable.

The model contains business logic and interaction with any database or other systems. View determines how data is rendered, if you want to use an HTML template, or output the data as JSON. Controllers should be lightweight and handle the interaction between user and the model(s) rendering the results with the required view.
