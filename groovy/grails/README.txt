Grails is an open source web application framework which uses the Groovy programming language (which is in turn based on the Java platform). It is intended to be a high-productivity framework by following the “coding by convention” paradigm, providing a stand-alone development environment and hiding much of the configuration detail from the developer.

Grails has been developed with a number of goals in mind:

Provide a high-productivity web framework for the Java platform.
Re-use proven Java technologies such as Hibernate and Spring under a simple, consistent interface
Offer a consistent framework which reduces confusion and is easy to learn.
Offer documentation for those parts of the framework which matter for its users.
Powerful and consistent persistence framework
Powerful and easy-to-use view templates using GSP (Groovy Server Pages).
Dynamic tag libraries to easily create web page components.
Provide a complete development mode, including web server and automatic reload of resources.
